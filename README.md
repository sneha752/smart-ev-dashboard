## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Real-time table displaying EV station data  
- 🤖 ML model (Linear Regression) to predict power usage  
- 📉 Bar, Line & Pie charts using Chart.js  
- 🚨 Smart alerts for low battery or high power draw  
- 🔍 Dropdown filter by station ID  
- 🧪 Fully software-based — no hardware needed!
